# D3-challenge

## Set Up
We work for a metro paper and we source from the US Census Bureau to run an analysis of their data. We compare information of residents by state and can plot different variables affecting the population to evaluate if any show a correlation.

## Findings
There are multiple correlations we can visualize with our interactive plot. The most interesting correlation I found was that the percentage of people who smoke along with the percentage of people that were obese went hand in hand with the percentage of the population in poverty. It seems that the as the states' population percentage in poverty increased the reported percentage of obesity and smokers also rose. More money essentially means a healthier population with less smokers and less obesity.
