          <h2>Health challenges against Income and Age</h2>
          <p>One correlation we found is that as individuals who smoke get older they tend to increase the amount that they
            smoke.The highest concentration of smokers lies between the ages of 34 and 44 years old. We find that in this 
            age span the highest percentage of smokers in most states is between 15 and 26 percent of the population.</p>

          <p>Another finding we can evaluate from our data is that as the percentage of people in poverty increases so does
            the percentage of people that smoke. Many of the same states that had a higher age median for smokers also have
          a higher percent of people in poverty.</p>

          <p>Lastly, the states with a lower household income also have a higher percentage of smokers. It is pretty easy to
            see that where people are smoking more poverty arises or vice versa. This is also true for the percentage of
            people that are obese. There is a direct correlation between the amount of money people make to their poor life 
            health conditions and choices.
